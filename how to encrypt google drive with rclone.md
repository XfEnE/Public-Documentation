give me an example rclone command to sync file dir to google drive with encrypted files

### ASSISTANT
To synchronize a directory to Google Drive with file encryption using `rclone`, you'll need to set up both a remote for Google Drive and a crypt remote. Here's how you can achieve this:

1. **Install Rclone**: Make sure `rclone` is installed on your system.

2. **Configure Google Drive Remote**:
   Run the following command and follow the prompts to configure access to your Google Drive.
   ```bash
   rclone config
   ```
   - Choose `n` for a new remote.
   - Name it (e.g., `gdrive`).
   - Select `Google Drive`.
   - Follow the steps to authenticate with Google.

3. **Configure Crypt Remote**:
   After setting up the Google Drive remote, configure the crypt remote.
   ```bash
   rclone config
   ```
   - Choose `n` for a new remote.
   - Name it (e.g., `gdrive_encrypted`).
   - Select `crypt`.
   - Set the storage backend to your previously configured Google Drive remote (e.g., `gdrive:`).
   - Follow prompts to set up encryption options, like choosing whether you want to encrypt file names.

4. **Sync Directory with Encryption**:
   Use the following command to sync a directory (`/path/to/local/dir`) to the encrypted Google Drive location.
   ```bash
   rclone sync /path/to/local/dir gdrive_encrypted:/path/on/drive
   ```
   - Replace `/path/to/local/dir` with your local directory path.
   - Replace `gdrive_encrypted` with the name you gave your crypt remote.
   - Replace `/path/on/drive` with the desired destination path on Google Drive.

### Additional Options:
- **Verbose Output**: Use `-v` for verbose output to see what's happening during the sync.
  ```bash
  rclone sync /path/to/local/dir gdrive_encrypted:/path/on/drive -v
  ```
- **Dry Run**: To simulate the operation without making changes, use `--dry-run`.
  ```bash
  rclone sync /path/to/local/dir gdrive_encrypted:/path/on/drive --dry-run
  ```

### Important Notes:
- Ensure you have sufficient storage space on Google Drive.
- Be cautious with encryption settings; losing your encryption passwords will make data recovery impossible.
- Regularly back up your `rclone` configuration file if it contains sensitive information.

### ASSISTANT
If the "Encrypt/Decrypt a remote" option is missing from your list of available remotes, it could be due to an outdated version of `rclone`. The crypt feature was introduced in later versions. Here's how you can address this issue:

### Steps to Enable Encryption with Rclone

1. **Update Rclone**:
   - Ensure that you have the latest version of `rclone` installed. You can download it from [Rclone's official website](https://rclone.org/downloads/).
   - On Linux, you might update it using a package manager or by downloading and following installation instructions directly.

2. **Install the Updated Version**:
   - If you need to install from source, follow these steps (on a Unix-like system):
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/rclone/rclone.git
     cd rclone
     go build
     sudo mv rclone /usr/bin/
     ```

3. **Reconfigure Rclone**:
   - Once updated, run the configuration again.
   ```bash
   rclone config
   ```
   - You should now see the "Encrypt/Decrypt a remote" option available as `14 / Encrypt/Decrypt a remote (crypt)`.

4. **Set Up Google Drive and Crypt Remotes**:

   - First, configure your Google Drive remote:
     1. Choose `n` for new remote.
     2. Name it (e.g., `gdrive`).
     3. Select `Google Drive`.
     4. Follow the authentication steps.

   - Next, configure your crypt remote:
     1. Again choose `n` for a new remote.
     2. Name it (e.g., `gdrive_encrypted`).
     3. Choose `14 / Encrypt/Decrypt a remote (crypt)`.
     4. Set the storage backend to your Google Drive remote (`gdrive:`).

5. **Sync Files with Encryption**:
   - Use the following command to sync files from a local directory to the encrypted Google Drive path:
     ```bash
     rclone sync /path/to/local/dir gdrive_encrypted:/path/on/drive
     ```
   - Replace `/path/to/local/dir` with your actual local directory.
   - Adjust `gdrive_encrypted` and `/path/on/drive` as necessary.

### Additional Tips

- **Check Version**: You can verify the installed version of `rclone` by running:
  ```bash
  rclone --version
  ```
- **Backup Configuration**: Always back up your configuration file located at `~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf` to avoid reconfiguration if something goes wrong.
- **Documentation**: Refer to [Rclone's official documentation](https://rclone.org/quickstart/) for detailed instructions and troubleshooting tips.

By following these steps, you should be able to set up and use the encryption feature with `rclone`.

### USER
how do you unencrypt the files?

### ASSISTANT
To decrypt files encrypted with Rclone's `crypt` backend, you need to sync or copy them from your encrypted remote back to a local directory. Here’s how you can do it:

### Steps to Decrypt Files

1. **Ensure Proper Configuration**:
   - Make sure that both your Google Drive (or any other cloud storage) and the `crypt` remotes are correctly configured in Rclone.

2. **Decrypt Using Sync or Copy**:
   - Use `rclone sync`, `rclone copy`, or similar commands to move files from the encrypted remote back to a local directory.
   
3. **Command Example**:

   If your encrypted remote is named `gdrive_encrypted` and you want to decrypt files stored in `/path/on/drive`, use the following command to copy them to a local folder, such as `/local/path/to/decrypted/files`:
   ```bash
   rclone copy gdrive_encrypted:/path/on/drive /local/path/to/decrypted/files
   ```

   - **sync vs. copy**: 
     - `rclone sync`: This will make the destination directory exactly match the source, including deleting files that no longer exist in the source.
     - `rclone copy`: This preserves both source and target directories as they are.

4. **Verify File Integrity**:
   - After running the command, check the local folder to ensure that all files have been decrypted correctly and can be accessed.

### Important Considerations

- **Original Files**: Ensure that you do not overwrite any original unencrypted files if they still exist.
  
- **Backup Configuration**: Always keep a backup of your Rclone configuration file located at `~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf`.

- **Permissions**: Ensure that the local directory where decrypted files will be copied has appropriate read/write permissions.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully decrypt and access your encrypted files.

If your computer crashed how would I setup rclone again to get the files ... I saved the commands , client ID. Client secret, and the crypt password...

### ASSISTANT
If your computer has crashed and you need to set up Rclone again to retrieve your files, having saved your commands, client ID, client secret, and the encryption password is a great start. Here's how you can get back up and running:

### Step-by-Step Guide to Reconfigure Rclone

1. **Install Rclone**:
   - First, reinstall Rclone on your new machine or repaired system.
     - Download it from [Rclone’s official website](https://rclone.org/downloads/).
     - Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

2. **Recreate Configuration File**:

   Since you saved key configuration details like client ID and secret, you can recreate your Rclone configuration file.

3. **Create a New Configuration File**:
   
   - Navigate to your home directory.
   - Create the necessary directories if they don’t exist:
     ```bash
     mkdir -p ~/.config/rclone/
     ```
   - Open or create the `rclone.conf` file using a text editor, such as `nano`, `vim`, or any other preferred text editor:
     ```bash
     nano ~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf
     ```

4. **Enter Configuration Details**:

   You’ll need to add entries for both your Google Drive and the crypt remote.

   - **Google Drive Remote**:
     ```ini
     [gdrive]
     type = drive
     client_id = YOUR_CLIENT_ID
     client_secret = YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
     scope = drive
     token = {"access_token":"YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN","token_type":"Bearer","refresh_token":"YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN","expiry":"EXPIRY_TIMESTAMP"}
     ```
   - **Crypt Remote**:
     ```ini
     [gdrive_encrypted]
     type = crypt
     remote = gdrive:/path/on/drive
     password = YOUR_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD
     ```

5. **Save and Exit**:
   - Save the file (`Ctrl + O` to save in `nano`, followed by `Enter`, then `Ctrl + X` to exit).

6. **Test Configuration**:

   Run a test command to ensure your configuration is correct and you can access your files.

   ```bash
   rclone lsd gdrive_encrypted:
   ```

   This should list directories at the root of your encrypted remote without actually decrypting them yet.

7. **Decrypt Files**:

   Once confirmed that Rclone can access your encrypted remote, proceed to decrypt and copy the files locally using a command like this:

   ```bash
   rclone copy gdrive_encrypted:/path/on/drive /local/path/to/decrypted/files
   ```

### Additional Tips

- **Access Token**: If you saved an access token that is no longer valid (it may expire), you'll need to reauthorize Rclone to generate a new one. You can do this by running the following command and following the instructions:
  ```bash
  rclone authorize "drive"
  ```

- **Backup**: Once everything is set up, consider backing up your `rclone.conf` file elsewhere for future contingencies.

- **Secure Storage**: Ensure that your client secret and encryption password are stored securely, as they allow access to your sensitive data. 

By following these steps, you should be able to reconfigure Rclone on a new system and access your encrypted files from Google Drive or any other supported cloud storage service.

### USER
rclone is running on a windows computer

### ASSISTANT
Setting up Rclone on a Windows machine requires some slightly different steps compared to Unix-like systems, but the core concepts remain the same. Here's how you can configure and use Rclone to access your encrypted files from Google Drive or any other cloud storage service:

### Step-by-Step Guide for Windows

   - Adding Rclone to your system's PATH makes it easier to run from any command prompt.
     1. Right-click on "This PC" or "Computer" and select "Properties."
     2. Click "Advanced system settings" and then the "Environment Variables" button.
     3. In the "System variables" section, find `Path` and click "Edit."
     4. Add a new entry for the Rclone installation directory (e.g., `C:\Program Files\ rclone`).

3. **Open Command Prompt**:
   - Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and press Enter.

4. **Create Configuration Directory and File**:

   - Navigate to your user home directory:
     ```shell
     cd \
     ```
   - Create a configuration directory if it doesn’t already exist:
     ```shell
     mkdir .config
     mkdir .config\rclone
     ```
   - Open `rclone.conf` in a text editor. You can use Notepad or any other text editor of your choice:
     ```shell
     notepad .\rclone\rclone.conf
     ```

5. **Enter Configuration Details**:

   Similar to the Unix setup, you'll need to configure both your Google Drive and the crypt remote.

   - **Google Drive Remote**:
     ```ini
     [gdrive]
     type = drive
     client_id = YOUR_CLIENT_ID
     client_secret = YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
     scope = drive
     token = {"access_token":"YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN","token_type":"Bearer","refresh_token":"YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN","expiry":"EXPIRY_TIMESTAMP"}
     ```

   - **Crypt Remote**:
     ```ini
     [gdrive_encrypted]
     type = crypt
     remote = gdrive:/path/on/drive
     password = YOUR_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD
     ```

6. **Save and Exit the Editor**.

7. **Test Configuration**:

   Run a command to ensure your configuration is set up correctly:
   ```shell
   rclone lsd gdrive_encrypted:
   ```
   This should list directories at the root of your encrypted remote.

8. **Decrypt Files Locally**:

   Once you’ve confirmed access, use Rclone to decrypt and copy files locally:
   ```shell
   rclone copy gdrive_encrypted:/path/on/drive D:\local\decrypted\files
   ```

### Additional Tips

- **Access Token**: If your access token is expired or missing, reauthorize Rclone by running:
  ```shell
  rclone authorize "drive"
  ```
  Follow the instructions in a web browser to authenticate.

- **Secure Storage**: Ensure that sensitive data like client secrets and encryption passwords are stored securely. Avoid hardcoding them into scripts unless necessary.

- **Backup Configuration**: After setting up, consider backing up your `rclone.conf` file to another secure location as a precaution.

By following these steps, you should be able to set up Rclone on a Windows system and access your encrypted files from Google Drive or other cloud services.
